Restro Project ‚Äî Setup + Daily Workflow

One-time setup

Backend (Python)

    Go to the project root:
    cd /Users/robynmai/Live-Builds/restaurant-project/restaurant
    Create and activate a virtual environment:
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    Install backend dependencies:
    pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

Frontend (Node.js)

    Go to the frontend folder:
    cd /Users/robynmai/Live-Builds/restaurant-project/restaurant/frontend
    Initialize npm and install Sass:
    npm init -y
    npm install sass --save-dev
    Add the build script to your package.json:
    npm pkg set "scripts.build:css"="sass styles/main.scss styles/main.css --watch"

Daily development workflow

You‚Äôll keep three terminals open.

üñ•Ô∏è Terminal 1 ‚Äî SCSS Watcher (styles)

    From the frontend folder:
    cd /Users/robynmai/Live-Builds/restaurant-project/restaurant/frontend
    npm run build:css
    Keep this running. You should see: ‚ÄúSass is watching for changes...‚Äù

üß† Terminal 2 ‚Äî Backend (AI API)

    From the project root:
    cd /Users/robynmai/Live-Builds/restaurant-project/restaurant
    source venv/bin/activate
    uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
    Keep this running. Test at: http://localhost:8000/health

üåê Terminal 3 ‚Äî Frontend (static site)

    From the frontend folder:
    cd /Users/robynmai/Live-Builds/restaurant-project/restaurant/frontend
    python -m http.server 8080
    Visit: http://localhost:8080

Notes and tips

    You only need to create the virtual environment and install dependencies once. After that, just run source venv/bin/activate when you start work.
    Stop any running server/watchers with Ctrl + C.
    If port 8080 is taken, try python -m http.server 8081 and visit http://localhost:8081.
